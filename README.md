Fast Crystal Tensor Property Prediction: A General O(3)-Equivariant Framework Based on Polar Decomposition

The experimental code is being collated and will be uploaded soon.

Our code is based on GMTNet: https://github.com/divelab/AIRS/tree/main/OpenMat/GMTNet

Some of the code comes from code from other methods, such as

ComFormer: https://github.com/divelab/AIRS/tree/main/OpenMat/ComFormer
